## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte index (starting from 0) in the deployed code. It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](link_to_instruction) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](link_to_group) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The **JUMPI** instruction may alter the program counter, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed code. It is used to implement functionalities like loops and conditions.

## Stack input

0. `Counter`: byte index in the deployed code where execution will continue from. Must be a [JUMPDEST](link_to_instruction) instruction.
1. `Boolean`: the program counter will be altered with the new value only if this value is different from 0. Otherwise, the program counter is simply incremented and the next instruction will be executed.

## Error cases

- Not enough values on the stack, see [here](link_to_future_page_to_explain).
- `Counter` index is not a [JUMPDEST](link_to_instruction): the execution is stopped. //TODO more details.
