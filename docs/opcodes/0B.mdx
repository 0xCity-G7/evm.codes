0. `Integer`: size in byte - 1 of the integer to sign extend.
1. `Integer`: value to sign extend.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: result of the sign extend.

## Examples

With the top stack value as 0 and the second stack value as 0xFF, the result is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
With the top stack value as 0 and the second stack value as 0x7F, the result is 0x7F.

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
