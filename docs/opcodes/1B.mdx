## Notes

Shift the bits towards the most significant one. The bits moved after the 256th one are discarded, the new bits are set to 0.

## Stack input

0. `Integer`: number of bits to shift to the left.
1. `Integer`: value.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: the shifted value. If the shift value is bigger than 255, returns 0.

## Examples

| Input | Output | | Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|-|------:|-------:|
| 1 | 2 | | 4 | 0xF000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| 1 | | | 0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
