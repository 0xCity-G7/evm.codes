## Notes

All values are treated as twoâ€™s complement signed 256-bit integers.

## Stack input

0. `Integer`: left side signed integer.
1. `Integer`: right side signed integer.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: 1 if the left side is bigger, 0 otherwise.

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
