## Stack input

0. `Integer`: 0-based byte index starting from the most significant byte.
1. `Integer`: value.

## Stack output

0. `Integer`: the indicated byte at the lest significant position. If the byte index is out of range, the result is 0.

## Examples

With the top stack value as 31 and the second stack value as 0xFF, the result is 0xFF.
With the top stack value as 30 and the second stack value as 0xFF00, the result is 0xFF.

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
